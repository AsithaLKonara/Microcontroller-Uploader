### 2. **🧠 Smart Reset**
- **What it does**: Progressive reset with verification and multiple fallback methods
- **Best for**: Boards that need multiple reset attempts
- **How it works**:
  - Checks current device state
  - Performs hardware reset via DTR/RTS
  - Waits for automatic flash mode entry
  - Attempts force download if needed

### 3. **⚡ Ultimate Reset**
- **What it does**: Combines all software reset techniques
- **Best for**: Very stubborn boards that resist other methods
- **How it works**:
  - ESP-01 specific reset methods
  - Enhanced hardware reset sequences
  - Force download with all techniques
  - Aggressive reset attempts

### 4. **🚨 Emergency Reset**
- **What it does**: Provides step-by-step manual reset instructions
- **Best for**: Single-button boards that can't be reset via software
- **How it works**:
  - Shows detailed manual reset sequence
  - Waits for user to complete the sequence
  - Tests if manual reset worked

## ⚙️ Configurable Reset Options

### Settings → esptool Reset Options

#### Before Upload:
- **`default-reset`**: Uses DTR/RTS lines to reset into bootloader (recommended)
- **`no-reset`**: Skips reset, useful if hardware isn't wired for reset
- **`usb-reset`**: USB reset (ESP32 only)

#### After Upload:
- **`hard-reset`**: Hard reset via DTR/RTS after upload (recommended)
- **`soft-reset`**: Soft reset after upload
- **`no-reset`**: No reset after upload

## 🎯 Recommended Reset Strategy

### For Most Boards:
1. **Start with 🔧 esptool Reset**
2. **If that fails, try 🧠 Smart Reset**

### For Single-Button Boards:
1. **Try 🔧 esptool Reset with `--before no-reset`**
2. **Use 🚨 Emergency Reset for manual control**
3. **Consider hardware modification (add GPIO0 switch)**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### Issue: "Device not in flash mode"
**Solutions**:
- Try `--before no-reset` in Settings
- Use 🚨 Emergency Reset for manual control
- Check if board has physical FLASH button

#### Issue: "DTR/RTS not working"
