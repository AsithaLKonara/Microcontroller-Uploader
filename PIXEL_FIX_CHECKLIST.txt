ðŸš¨ PIXEL NOT WORKING - QUICK FIX CHECKLIST
============================================

âœ… IMMEDIATE CHECKS (Do these first):

1. POWER SUPPLY:
   â–¡ Are you using 5V power supply? (NOT 3.3V)
   â–¡ Is power supply rated for 2-3A (8x8) or 8-10A (16x16)?
   â–¡ Are you NOT powering LEDs from USB?

2. CONNECTIONS:
   â–¡ VCC â†’ 5V Power Supply
   â–¡ GND â†’ Common Ground (shared with ESP8266)
   â–¡ DIN â†’ GPIO2 (or your defined pin)
   â–¡ All wires are solid and not loose?

3. DEVICE STATUS:
   â–¡ Is ESP8266 power LED on?
   â–¡ Did you reset device after upload?
   â–¡ Is device actually running? (check serial monitor)

ðŸ”§ QUICK FIXES TO TRY:

1. RESET DEVICE:
   â–¡ Press reset button on ESP8266
   â–¡ Disconnect power for 10 seconds
   â–¡ Reconnect and try again

2. CHANGE GPIO PIN:
   â–¡ Try GPIO4 instead of GPIO2
   â–¡ Try GPIO5 instead of GPIO2
   â–¡ Try GPIO12 instead of GPIO2

3. CHECK SERIAL MONITOR:
   â–¡ Connect via USB
   â–¡ Open serial monitor at 115200 baud
   â–¡ Reset device and watch for messages
   â–¡ Look for "LED Test Starting..." or similar

4. UPLOAD TEST CODE:
   â–¡ Use the ESP8266_LED_Test.ino file
   â–¡ Install Adafruit_NeoPixel library
   â–¡ Upload and test

ðŸš¨ MOST COMMON ISSUES:

1. WRONG VOLTAGE: Using 3.3V instead of 5V
2. INSUFFICIENT CURRENT: USB power limited to ~500mA
3. WRONG GPIO: Using boot pins (GPIO0, GPIO15, GPIO16)
4. LOOSE CONNECTIONS: Cold solder joints or loose wires
5. DEVICE NOT RUNNING: Code uploaded but device not reset

ðŸ’¡ TESTING STEPS:

1. Start with minimal test code
2. Use external 5V power supply
3. Test with simple colors first (red, green, blue)
4. Check serial monitor for error messages
5. Verify hardware connections with multimeter

ðŸ“± NEED HELP?

Share these details:
- What type of upload (.dat, .bin, .hex)?
- What hardware (ESP8266 model, LED type, matrix size)?
- What connections (VCC voltage, GPIO pin, power supply)?
- What happens when powered on?
- Any serial monitor output?
- Any error messages?

ðŸŽ¯ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:

After successful upload:
1. Device should auto-reset to run mode
2. Serial monitor should show startup messages
3. LEDs should respond to test patterns
4. Colors should cycle through red, green, blue, etc.
5. Individual LEDs should light up in sequence

If none of this works, the issue is likely:
- Hardware connection problem
- Power supply issue
- Wrong GPIO pin
- Device not actually running the code
